 * from the hit show Firefly.
 * 
 * let captain = "Mal";
 * let second = "Zoe";
 * let pilot = "Wash";
 * let companion = "Inara";
 * let mercenary = "Jayne";
 * let mechanic = "Kaylee";
 * 
 * let crew = [captain, second, pilot, companion, mercenary, mechanic];
 * Later in the show, Mal takes on three new crew members named "Simon",
